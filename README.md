# SegaMpegBoard!

Drop in replacement board for Sega Model 3 Mpeg board.
Tested on Scud Race but can't see why it would not work in other aracdes with the same mpeg board.

It uses the cheap DFPlayer MP3 module for soundtrack files and attiny84 for the communication.

IMPORTANT NOTE!
The attiny might need a clock calibration to work. 
I supposed it would be smart to add an external clock, but I didn't.
Fell free to modify the design yourself or search the web for attiny clock calibration.
